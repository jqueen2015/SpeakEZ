Young children of Spanish-speaking immigrants face challenges in learning English vocabulary and pronunciation due to a lack of interactive and real-time learning tools. As a result, they struggle to connect English words with objects in their environment effectively.To address this challenge, we propose developing an Arduino-based object recognition and translation robot that helps ESOL students learn English more effectively. The robot will use a camera and Al-powered object recognition to identify physical objects in real-time. It will then display the object's name on a screen and provide voice output for pronunciation. Additionally, the system will be designed for portability, allowing students to use it in various learning environments.
